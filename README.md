# 🕌 Nobd (نَبْض) – Muslim Routine Tracker

> _"Reflect daily, improve consistently."_  
> **Nobd** (نَبْض) is a serene, minimal web application designed to help Muslims maintain balance and consistency in their worship (`ʿibādāt`) and worldly (`dunyā`) habits.

It allows you to track your daily prayers, remembrance, good deeds, and productive routines — encouraging self-reflection and mindful improvement.

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Nobd** is a Muslim routine tracker that visualizes your spiritual and personal progress across four main categories:

| Category                  | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ṣalāh (Prayer)**        | Track your five daily prayers with pre/post steps and punctuality.    |
| **Adhkār (Remembrances)** | Morning and evening adhkār and post-prayer dhikr.                     |
| **General ʿIbādāt**       | Voluntary fasting, charity, Qur’an recitation, and duʿāʾ.             |
| **Dunyā (Worldly life)**  | Reading, studying, exercising, journaling — balancing faith and life. |

Each activity has a three-state tracking system:

-   ⬜ Not done
-   🟨 Done (late)
-   🟩 Done (on time)

## 🗺️ Roadmap (MVP Phases Overview)

Nobd will evolve through several **MVP stages**, each expanding on functionality while maintaining simplicity.  
This roadmap outlines the _conceptual development path_ — not specific technical tasks.

---
